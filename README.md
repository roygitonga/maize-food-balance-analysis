# maize-food-balance-analysis

# sample R code for analyzing a food balance sheet for maize. This code calculates basic components of a food balance sheet, such as production, imports, exports, total availability, and per capita consumption. It uses hypothetical data for simplicity but can be adapted to use real data from sources like FAO or local government databases.

#The example assumes the following structure for the food balance sheet:

### production: local production of maize
###    imports: total imports
###    exports: total exports
###    stocks_opening: opening stock of maize
###    stocks_closing: closing stock of maize
###    population: population of the region or country

# The food balance for maize is then calculated based on these inputs.
